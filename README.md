# Fault Tolerant Microservices

## Context
This application was made as a part of a [presentation](https://github.com/luwojtaszek/fault-tolerant-microservices/blob/master/presentation/Presentation_20180507.pdf) I gave on May 2018.

The main purpose is to show how to use Neftlix libraries (Feign + Hystrix) and  RxJava in order to create fault tolerant and asynchronous communication between microservices.
